## 📜 Project Overview
The **Density-Based Traffic Control System** is a dynamic traffic management solution designed to ease traffic congestion by adjusting signal timings based on the density of vehicles on each lane at an intersection. The project utilizes an **Arduino Uno**, **IR sensors**, and **Ultrasonic sensors** to detect the vehicle presence and density, ensuring efficient and adaptive traffic control in real-time. 🌐

### 🎯 **Objective**
To dynamically control traffic lights based on real-time vehicle density, allowing smoother traffic flow and reducing roadblocks in metropolitan areas.

## ⚙️ Features
- Real-time vehicle detection using **Infrared and Ultrasonic Sensors**.
- Adaptive traffic light control based on vehicle density.
- Efficient traffic flow management, prioritizing lanes with more traffic.
- Easy integration with **Smart City Systems** for traffic management.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Infrared Sensors** detect the presence of vehicles in each lane.
2. **Ultrasonic Sensors** measure the distance between vehicles to determine traffic density.
3. The system prioritizes lanes with higher vehicle density and adjusts the traffic light timings dynamically.

## 🛠️ Components Used
- **Arduino Uno** - Microcontroller for traffic light control.
- **IR Sensors** - Vehicle presence detection.
- **Ultrasonic Sensors** - Vehicle density measurement.
- **LEDs** - Simulated traffic lights (Red, Yellow, Green).
